# BÆNG 💥

BÆNG is an imperative-procedural programming language designed for the synthetic generation of reverberation impulse responses.

## Overview

BÆNG enables algorithmic creation of impulse responses by directly manipulating individual audio samples. Programs consist of function definitions, parameters, sequential instructions, and loops. Upon function invocation, the language iterates over the samples of a pre-initialized impulse response, applying conditional logic to shape acoustic effects such as reflections and echoes.

This project was developed in the context of a university seminar on computer music and multimedia, focusing on experimental approaches to sound synthesis and transformation.

## Features

- Imperative-procedural structure
- Sample-level audio processing
- Rule-based sound design without external libraries
- Arithmetic operations including:
  - Absolute value
  - Rounding
  - Integer division
  - Boolean logic
  - Comparison operators
- Offline computation (no real-time audio)
- Output as `.wav` file containing the generated impulse response

## Use Cases

BÆNG is suitable for:

- Experimental reverb synthesis
- Research in acoustic modeling
- Custom impulse response generation for convolution-based audio effects
